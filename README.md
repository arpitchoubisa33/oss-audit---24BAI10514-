# Open Source Software Audit: VLC Media Player
**Student:** Arpit Choubisa 
**Roll Number:** 24BAI10514
**Course:** Open Source Software (OSS)  

## Project Overview
This repository serves as the practical documentation for my Open Source Software Audit project. For this assignment, I chose to audit **VLC Media Player**, a cornerstone of the FOSS community. The project explores the software's history (originating at École Centrale Paris), its licensing under the GNU GPL v2, and its technical footprint on a Linux system.

The goal was to move beyond just using the software and actually understand the "Four Freedoms" that govern its development and distribution.

## System Environment
To conduct this audit, I utilized the following environment:
* **Operating System:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (running via WSL2)
* **Shell:** GNU bash, version 5.2.21
* **Audited Version:** VLC media player 3.0.20 (Vetinari)

## Shell Script Portfolio
I developed five specific Bash scripts to automate the auditing process. Each script addresses a different unit of the OSS syllabus:

1. **script1.sh (System Identity):** Automatically fetches the Linux kernel version and OS release to verify the audit environment.
2. **script2.sh (Package Inspector):** Checks if VLC is correctly installed via the `apt` package manager and locates its binary path.
3. **script3.sh (Permission Auditor):** Scans critical system directories to report on file permissions and disk usage.
4. **script4.sh (Log Analyzer):** A diagnostic tool that parses system logs for specific keywords like "error" or "warning."
5. **script5.sh (OSS Manifesto):** An interactive script that captures user reflections on software freedom and generates a formatted manifesto file.

## How to Run the Scripts
To verify the scripts on your local Ubuntu environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/DashkratSrivastava/oss-audit--24BCE11239-.git](https://github.com/DashkratSrivastava/oss-audit--24BCE11239-.git)
   cd oss-audit--24BCE11239-
